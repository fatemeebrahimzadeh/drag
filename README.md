This repository provides a helper function for implementing drag functionality in a web application. The function can be used with any container element that you want to make draggable. To use this helper function, you first need to define a reference to the container element that you want to drag, and then call the Drag function with that reference. The helper function returns a new function that you should assign to the container element to enable drag functionality. Once assigned, the container can be dragged to any desired location. This helper function can be used to implement drag functionality in a variety of web applications, making it a useful and reusable tool.
